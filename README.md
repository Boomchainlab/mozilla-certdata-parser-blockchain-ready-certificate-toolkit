# mozilla-certdata-parser-blockchain-ready-certificate-toolkit
By bridging traditional PKI with blockchain ecosystems, Boomchainlab empowers secure certificate validation, oracle trust anchors, smart contract integrations, and decentralized identity frameworks—all vital for robust Web3 security.

🚀 Project Overview

The Mozilla Root CA program provides the authoritative list of trusted root certificates in a specialized certdata.txt format. Boomchainlab’s tooling automates transforming these certificates into PEM-encoded files and structured JSON metadata, enabling seamless interoperability between traditional PKI and modern decentralized ecosystems.

Our solution powers robust certificate validation pipelines within blockchain environments, fortifying your applications with verifiable, up-to-date cryptographic trust anchors.

🎯 Key Capabilities
	•	End-to-end extraction of all root certificates from Mozilla’s certdata.txt
	•	Conversion into PEM format for cryptographic libraries and blockchain clients
	•	Comprehensive JSON metadata output describing certificate properties and trust flags
	•	Plug-and-play with blockchain oracles, smart contracts, and identity systems
	•	Continuous sync-ready architecture to stay aligned with Mozilla’s root store updates

🌐 Why Boomchainlab Builds This

In decentralized infrastructures, trust is paramount. Blockchain systems require secure cryptographic verification frameworks that interact with off-chain trust anchors. Boomchainlab empowers blockchain developers and enterprises to leverage the trusted Mozilla Root Store — enhancing security, compliance, and interoperability across your Web3 stack.

🛠 Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8+ environment
	•	OpenSSL or compatible cryptographic toolkits
	•	Latest certdata.txt from Mozilla’s repository

 Installation & Setup
 git clone https://github.com/Boomchainlab/mozilla-certdata-parser.git
cd mozilla-certdata-parser
pip install -r requirements.txt

Execution
curl -O https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/raw-file/default/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt
python parse_certdata.py --input certdata.txt --output ./output

Output Artifacts
	•	certificates.pem: Concatenated PEM certificates ready for blockchain node or oracle integration
	•	certificates.json: Detailed JSON metadata with trust attributes for on-chain or off-chain verification logic
	•	Individual PEM files per root CA (optional)

⸻

🔗 Blockchain Integration Use Cases
	•	Oracle Trust Anchors: Secure data feeds with verified certificate chains
	•	Smart Contract Validation: Off-chain verification of SSL/TLS certificates using JSON metadata
	•	Decentralized Identity: Enhance DID schemes with trusted root CAs for authentication
	•	Node Security: Embed trusted PEM certificates in blockchain node configurations for external connectivity
